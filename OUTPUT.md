# Agent: Blood Report Summarization Expert
## Task:
                Analyze the blood report and provide a summary to the user

                - The report will contain various categories related to blood with defined values.
                - Determine if each category's value is within the normal range.
                - If the normal range is provided, compare the value to it; otherwise, search the internet to determine if the value is normal for a human.
                - Summarize the report, indicating which categories are normal and which are abnormal.
                - Summarize the report, indicating which categories are normal and which are abnormal.
